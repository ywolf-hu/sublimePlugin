Rsync SSH 1.4.3
---------------

- Remote path no longer has to exist in advance for sync to be successful.
  Full remote path will created during sync.
- We now use which instead of type to find rsync on the remote host.
- Fixed issue #17, it is now allowed to have the basename more thant once in
  a folder path.
